New plan:

Since Alex auto-forwards the zoom links to me now, I can learn the gmail API to auto extra the link and password from
the email.  This will also have the correct date, so no complex logic needed to figure out which day the lecture
is actually for.

This solves the Slack scraping issue, yikes.

Every other Saturday, auto put that it's the PA walkthrough into the topics!
